This folder contrains two files, the sources for an App Inventor app (.aia) and
the compiled version of the app (.apk).

The compiled version is ready to be used. The sources do not contain a key and
secret for the Twitter component. Please consult the App Inventor documentation
to see how to register your app with the Twitter development platform.

App created by Jos <josmasflores@gmail.com> with all design work by Edwin
