peacecorps_challenge_rhok13
===========================

A repo to store stuff for the Peace Corps challenge at Random Hacks of Kindness 13 : Boston

By using already existing Open Source Software (instead of reinventing the wheel),
our team got a full end to end reporting system up and running, with forms that
can be stored in the server, filled in in the phone, and sent back to
the server. We also created a small App Inventor wrapper app that adds some
collaboration and sharing functionality such as integration with Twitter, SMS,
and visualisation through Google maps.

There is a short presentation in ppt and pdf in the presentation folder, and
more information can be found in hackpad at:
https://hackpad.com/Peace-Corps-notebook-ERMEO6OOy0r

The two main projects used were the Open Data Kit (http://opendatakit.org/) for
data collection, and the App Inventor
(http://appinventor.mit.edu/appinventor-sources/) to add collaboration and
sharing funcitonality to the mobile app.

The RealTrack Team!
