peacecorps_challenge_rhok13
===========================

A repo to store stuff for the Peace Corps challenge at Random Hacks of Kindness 13 : Boston

Our team got a full end to end reporting system up and running, with forms that
can be stored in the server and visualise/fill in in the phone, and sent back to
the server. We also created a small App Inventor wrapper app that adds some
collaboration and sharing functionality such as integration with Twitter, SMS,
and visualisation through Google maps.

There is a short presentation in ppt and pdf in the presentation folder, and
more information can be found in hackpad at:
